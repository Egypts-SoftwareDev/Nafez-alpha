# Business Model & Financials

## Revenue Streams

1. **Platform Commission:** A tiered commission on funds raised (5–8 %).  Lower fees (e.g., 5 %) apply to charitable or social‑impact campaigns; higher tiers (7–8 %) apply to commercial projects with larger budgets.  This aligns with industry benchmarks and covers platform operations.

2. **Payment Processing Fees:** Payment service providers like Paymob charge 2.75 % + EGP 3 per transaction.  These fees are passed on to creators or backers depending on the campaign’s configuration.  Nafez may negotiate volume discounts as transaction volume grows.

3. **Premium Services:** Optional upgrades such as professional campaign audits, featured placement on the homepage, video production packages, social media marketing, and Seekers Plus (an enhanced verification badge) will generate additional revenue.

4. **Advertising & Sponsorship:** Branded placement on discovery pages and sponsored newsletter slots offer further monetisation.  VAT law amendments in 2025 include advertising services in the standard 14 % rate, so these revenues must be taxed accordingly.

5. **Interest on Escrow Balances:** Subject to regulatory approval, funds held in escrow could earn interest or be placed in Sharia‑compliant money market accounts, providing a small but stable income stream to offset operating costs.

## Cost Structure

– **Payment Processing Costs:** Pass‑through PSP fees; small residual risk of chargebacks and failed transactions.

– **Staff & Operations:** Salaries for software developers, product managers, compliance officers, customer support agents, marketing staff and finance.  Anticipate lean headcount during MVP (8–10 people) scaling to ~25 by Year 2.

– **Legal & Compliance:** Licensing fees with the FRA, costs of obtaining PDPL and AML approvals, legal counsel, and ongoing audits.

– **Technology Infrastructure:** Cloud hosting (e.g., AWS or local equivalent), domain registration, SSL certificates, security software, analytics tools, and third‑party integrations (KYC providers, SMS providers).  Early expenses are modest but scale with traffic.

– **Marketing & Community Building:** Launch events, digital advertising, creator outreach programs, referral incentives and educational webinars.

## Financial Model Skeleton

A separate Excel file (`financial_model_skeleton.xlsx`) is included.  It provides a template to forecast revenue and expenses based on variables such as number of campaigns, average funding per campaign, commission rate, PSP fees, staff salaries, marketing budget and compliance costs.  The model contains three sheets:

1. **Inputs:** Assumptions such as campaign volume, average pledge size, commission rate, PSP fee, average number of transactions per campaign, salary bands and marketing spend.  Adjust these to explore different scenarios.

2. **Income Statement:** Calculates gross revenue (commissions + premium services + advertising), subtracts PSP costs and operating expenses to derive EBITDA and net profit.

3. **Cash Flow:** Projects cash inflows and outflows over a three‑year period, including capital expenditure, working capital and runway requirements.
