# Operations, Trust & Policies

## Trust & Verification

– **Identity Verification:** All creators must provide a national ID or passport, selfie, and proof of address.  For campaigns above a certain threshold, a police clearance certificate and proof of company incorporation are required.

– **Project Vetting:** A moderation team reviews campaign descriptions, reward feasibility, and intellectual property claims.  High‑risk categories (health, fintech, real estate) undergo additional due diligence and may require professional certifications.

– **KYC/AML Compliance:** Both creators and backers must pass customer due diligence in line with Law No. 80/2002 and its 2023 reforms.  The platform integrates with a KYC provider offering facial recognition and document verification.  Suspicious transactions are reported via the GoAML platform, as mandated by the CBE and FRA.  Continuous monitoring flags unusual pledge patterns.

– **Escrow & Funds Flow:** Pledges are collected into a segregated account held by a licensed bank or trust.  Funds are released to creators only if the campaign meets its funding goal and verification is completed.  Refunds are processed automatically for unsuccessful campaigns, minus transaction fees where applicable.  Disbursements are made via bank transfer or InstaPay to the creator’s account.

## Refunds & Dispute Resolution

– **Unsuccessful Campaigns:** If a campaign does not meet its funding goal by the deadline, all pledges are cancelled and backers receive a full refund through their original payment method.  PSP fees may not be recoverable.

– **Campaign Cancellation:** Creators may cancel a campaign before it ends; backers are refunded.  Cancellation after success requires approval and may lead to partial refunds based on progress.

– **Product Issues & Delays:** As Nafez is a facilitator, creators are responsible for delivering rewards.  Backers can request refunds directly from creators.  Nafez offers mediation and may suspend creators who repeatedly fail to deliver.

– **Chargebacks & Fraud:** A dedicated risk team handles chargeback disputes.  Creators may be held liable for excessive chargebacks and may forfeit fees or deposits.

## Legal & Compliance Checklist

– **FinTech Law No. 5/2022:** Determine whether rewards‑based crowdfunding requires licensing under the FRA.  Engage legal counsel to clarify whether the platform operates under e‑commerce rules or needs a non‑banking financial services licence.  Prepare to enter the FRA sandbox if needed.

– **Personal Data Protection Law No. 151/2020 (PDPL):** Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) and conduct data protection impact assessments.  Obtain consent from users for data processing, enable rights to access/erase data and prepare cross‑border transfer procedures requiring approval from the Data Protection Centre (PDPC).

– **VAT Law No. 67/2016 & Law No. 157/2025 Amendments:** Register for VAT and apply the standard 14 % rate on platform commissions and advertising services.  Monitor sector‑specific changes (e.g., advertising now subject to VAT) and consult tax advisors.

– **AML Law No. 80/2002 & Decree No. 3331/2023:** Implement risk‑based customer due diligence, identify ultimate beneficial owners, integrate with the GoAML platform and enforce continuous monitoring.  Comply with CBE manual (January 2025) on ownership structures and FRA Decree 161/2024 requiring digital identity verification.

– **Consumer Protection Law & E‑Commerce Regulations:** Ensure transparent campaign terms, clear refund policies and disclosures of risks.  Provide Arabic language versions of all agreements.

– **Copyright & Intellectual Property:** Require creators to certify ownership or permission to use all media.  Remove infringing content upon notice.

– **Terms of Service, Privacy Policy & AML/KYC Policy:** Provide clear legal agreements covering user responsibilities, platform liability, data collection/usage, sanctions screening and dispute resolution.

## Security

– **Encryption:** Use HTTPS for all traffic; encrypt data at rest using industry‑standard algorithms; implement tokenisation of payment information.

– **Access Controls:** Enforce role‑based access for staff; require multi‑factor authentication for administrators and creators; log all actions.

– **Vulnerability Management:** Regular penetration testing and code reviews; patch management; participation in bug‑bounty programs.

– **Incident Response:** Develop an incident response plan, including data breach notification procedures aligned with PDPL requirements.

– **Data Retention:** Define retention periods for personal and financial data; anonymise or delete data when no longer needed.

## Support Playbooks

– **Tiered Support:** Provide Level 1 chat/email support for basic inquiries, Level 2 for escalation, and Level 3 for legal or technical issues.  Maintain a knowledge base of FAQs.

– **Service Level Targets:** Acknowledge inquiries within 12 hours; resolve most issues within 48 hours.  Monitor satisfaction via surveys.

– **Dispute Mediation:** Train support staff to mediate between creators and backers; maintain documentation of all interactions and outcomes.

– **Creator Success Program:** Offer onboarding sessions, best‑practice webinars and campaign audits to improve campaign outcomes.

## Brand & Copy

– **Brand Voice:** Trustworthy, empowering and locally resonant.  Use clear Arabic and English language, avoid jargon, and highlight community impact.

– **Messaging Themes:** “Empowering Egypt’s creators,” “Your ideas, funded locally,” “Pre‑order the future today.”

– **Marketing Collateral:** Templates for campaign banners, video scripts, social media posts, email newsletters and blog articles.  Ensure compliance with advertising regulations and VAT rules.

– **Accessibility:** Provide guidance for accessible campaign pages (alt text, colour contrast, font size) and offer human support for creators with limited technical skills.
