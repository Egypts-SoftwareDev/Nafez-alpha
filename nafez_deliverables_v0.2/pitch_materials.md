# Pitch Materials

This document provides a high‑level outline for the investor pitch deck and elevator pitch.  The deck should be visually engaging, tell a compelling story and emphasise the opportunity.

## Elevator Pitch

"Nafez is Egypt’s first fully localised rewards‑based crowdfunding platform.  We empower innovators, makers and artists to pre‑sell their products and ideas using local payment methods, while backers get exclusive access to the next big thing.  With integrated pledge management, flexible payment options and rigorous compliance, Nafez unlocks a new source of capital for the MENA region."
