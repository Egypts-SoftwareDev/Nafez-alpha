# Executive Summary

Nafez is a proposed **rewards‑based crowdfunding platform** built specifically for Egypt’s creative and entrepreneurial community. It will give local founders, makers and artists a trusted way to pre‑sell their products and ideas while connecting them with backers who want to support innovation. The platform sits at the intersection of e‑commerce and fintech: projects are published with funding goals and reward tiers, backers pledge using familiar local payment methods, and funds are held in escrow until campaign conditions are met.

**Problem & Opportunity.** Egypt’s startup scene is booming, yet access to capital for early‑stage ideas remains limited. Traditional lenders avoid unproven concepts, while global reward platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo are not fully localised and often unavailable to Egyptian creators. Fintech adoption and mobile payments have surged in recent years, creating a fertile market for reward‑based crowdfunding.

**Solution.** Nafez will provide an end‑to‑end crowdfunding journey: creators can design campaigns with reward tiers, set funding goals, communicate with backers and manage fulfillment through an integrated pledge manager. Backers will discover projects, pledge securely using Paymob or InstaPay, and join communities around the products they love. Key differentiators include:

• **Local payments & settlement:** Integration with local payment service providers (PSPs) such as Paymob (2.75% + EGP 3 per transaction) and InstaPay for immediate mobile transfers and weekly settlements. Funds are released from escrow after a successful campaign and verification.
• **Built‑in pledge management & add‑ons:** Inspired by Kickstarter’s 2025 roadmap, the platform will offer an integrated pledge manager to collect shipping, taxes and late pledges. Backers can split pledges into instalments similar to Kickstarter’s Pledge Over Time feature.
• **Trust & compliance:** Every creator undergoes identity and criminal record checks. Funds are held in segregated accounts to comply with Egypt’s FinTech Law No. 5/2022 and the Personal Data Protection Law No. 151/2020. Anti‑money‑laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes follow updated 2023/2025 guidelines.
• **Community & gamification:** Badges, leaderboards and social sharing encourage backers to discover new projects and reward early support. An integrated referral program helps creators widen their reach.

**Business Model.** Nafez will earn revenue from a **platform commission** (5–8% of funds raised, tiered by campaign category), processing fees passed through from payment partners, premium services (e.g., verification packages, marketing boosts) and advertising placements. The VAT Law No. 67/2016 applies a 14 % VAT on most services and advertising; amendments in 2025 extend the standard rate to advertising and news agency services. The model allows for discounted rates for charitable or socially impactful campaigns.

**Traction & Next Steps.** The minimum viable product (MVP) is planned for a 30‑day build and will launch with a curated cohort of test projects. Over the next 12 months, the team will: secure a non‑banking financial licence with the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA), finalise an escrow arrangement with a local bank, release a mobile app, and expand pledge management features. Pending local regulatory clarity on rewards‑based crowdfunding and data protection, Nafez has the potential to unlock significant new capital for Egypt’s innovators.
