# Research Backlog

This document lists outstanding questions and areas requiring further investigation to de‑risk the business and refine the product.

1. **Regulatory Classification:** Confirm with the Financial Regulatory Authority whether a rewards‑based crowdfunding platform requires a non‑banking financial services licence or qualifies as an e‑commerce marketplace.  Determine if the FRA sandbox is necessary.

2. **Escrow Mechanics:** Identify legally acceptable escrow models in Egypt — e.g., segregated trust accounts, third‑party trustees or bank guarantee structures.  Clarify whether split settlements through Paymob are permissible.

3. **Data Protection Compliance:** Monitor issuance of executive regulations for PDPL 151/2020 and the establishment of the Data Protection Centre (PDPC).  Understand requirements for cross‑border transfers, licensing and data breach notifications.

4. **VAT Obligations:** Obtain local tax advice on applying VAT to platform commissions, advertising revenues, shipping charges and digital services.  Assess the impact of 2025 amendments that tax advertising and certain services at 14 % and require invoicing compliance.

5. **AML/KYC Requirements:** Keep abreast of CBE and FRA guidelines on digital identity verification, ownership transparency and suspicious transaction reporting.  Evaluate third‑party KYC providers compatible with Egyptian documents.

6. **Payment Partnerships:** Explore additional payment options (Fawry, bank direct debit, BNPL services such as valU) and negotiate volume pricing with Paymob.  Research integration options for cross‑border payments if expansion to GCC markets occurs.

7. **Competitor Feature Set:** Track new features from Kickstarter, Gamefound, Indiegogo and BackerKit, particularly around pledge management, instalment payments, marketing tools and community features.  Analyse how those features drive user retention and revenue.

8. **Logistics & Fulfilment:** Research local shipping and fulfilment partners (e.g., Aramex, Egypt Post, Mylerz) and assess integration requirements for order tracking and automated shipping rate calculation.

9. **User Behaviour:** Conduct user research on Egyptian creators and backers to understand motivations, pain points, preferred payment methods and trust barriers.  Test messaging and pricing sensitivity.

10. **International Expansion:** Study regulatory environments in neighbouring countries (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan) for potential expansion, focusing on crowdfunding rules, data protection laws and payment systems.
